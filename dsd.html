            <p>We followed the process of Lean Service Creation. The project started by understanding the customer's business objectives. Then we interviewed district heating companies and board members of limited liability housing companies to understand their painpoints and needs.</p>
            <p>We did a short version of Google Sprint and ideated few concepts based on insights we had gained. The final concept was validated with real users using fake-ads and interviews. For example we distributed brochures for the residents of housing company.</p>
            <p>My role in the project was to conduct user research and to design fake ads and validate our assumptions. In addition, I was presenting the final presentation together with another team member.</p>

            <p class="caption mb20">Video made for Leanheat explaining our concept validation (only in Finnish).</p>
            <p>Our final concept was to provide Leanheat's solution as a part of the district heating. The idea was that the housing companies would get a new upgraded district heating product by updating their current contracts. With this solution it would be possible to bypass the decision making about a new investment.</p>

            <p>My build-measure-learn mindset became stronger and I gained a lot of domain information from a complex business scenario. Leanheat was super impressed  with our validation and they gained important insights from private housing companies. The solution was described as simple yet effective.</p>
