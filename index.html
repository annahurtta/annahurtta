          </div>
          <div class="col-md-8 mb60">
            <p>Leanheat provides a software solution that enables the space heating optimization of centrally heated multifamily residential buildings. This is done by installing wireless sensors to track temperature and humidity, and a connection to the central heating controller is established. The system collects data from apartments, heating system and weather in order to automatically create a thermodynamic model for the building. Then the space heating is optimized based on the parameters resulting a minimized simultaneous usage of heat and thus lowering the peak loads caused by it.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-md-4">
            <p class="title">Business Objective</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-md-8 mb60">
            <p>In Finland, from the big apartment buildings around one third is owned by the professional property owners and in that specific market the case company is already the market lead. The rest of the buildings are housing companies which means that reaching them as clients is strategically important in order to grow bigger in the market. Leanheat and district heating companies are forming partnerships because the system provides a way for the district heating companies to optimize their energy production. Moreover, consumer customers are becoming active in acquiring services which means that the energy companies should be more active in providing service business in order to engage better with their customers.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-md-4">
            <p class="title">Goal</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-md-8 mb60">
            <p>Selling services for housing companies requires resources and knowledge about how they operate and the reasons for their actions. On top of that, district heating companies are valuable since currently they have their existing customer relationships with housing companies because they provide them heat.</p>
            <p>The goal of the study was to create new and better understanding about the purchase decision making process inside housing companies by exploring the background motivation for people to be in the board and what affects the decision making. Additionally, the goal was to design and develop a sales process guidance and guidelines on how to reach the potential market of the housing companies</p>
            <p>The main research questions were</p>
              <ul class="responsibilities">
                <li>What affects the purchase decision making process in a limited liability housing companies?</li>
                <li>How to improve current sales process with the knowledge of limited liability housing company‚Äôs decision making process?</li>

            <p class="title">Design process</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-md-8 mb60">
            <p>The research followed the design science research methodology and it was conducted as a service design project with the help of Lean Service Creation. I started the project by forming an understanding of the current state of the business. I took part in different meetings and conducted interviews with the board members of housing companies. Additionally, I designed support material for sales and iterated those based on feedback and interviews.</p>

            <p class="caption mb40">The research process and the conducted activities.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">User research & data gathering:</span> To answer the first research question I interviewed board members of housing companies. I wanted to find out why they were part of the board, what things influence their decision making and how they make investment decisions. I decided to do semi-structured interviews in order to discover the real feelings and operations inside the board. In addition, I wanted to understand the current sales process by mapping customer journey together with energy company. Based on the insights I decided to focus my research on awareness, engagement and purchase phases because those were the biggest bottlenecks.</p>

            <p class="caption mb20">Example insights from interviews.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Prototyping:</span> I designed new material to support the sales for consumer customers. I also took part in an open day event where I was able to test personal selling and provide support for the decision making. Lastly, I designed fake ads to test and find out which pricing model is thought as ‚Äúeasiest to buy‚Äù among housing companies. The test was conducted in a housing company fair where the ads were shown for board members and asked their feedback.</p>

            <p class="title">Result</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-md-8 mb60">
            <p>Main insights gained from the interviews were that the purchase decision making is mainly affected by the motivation of the board, the deputy landlord‚Äôs role and board culture.</p>
            <p>I identifed three different board cultures based on their goals and board members. Additionally, I also suggested improvments for the awarness, engagement and purchase phase. For example, the pricing model moved from investment based to service fee based model.</p>
            <img src="img/boardtypes.png" alt="Leanheat board types" class="img-responsive img-case img-case-small">
            <p class="caption mb20">Identified board cultures.</p>
            <p>I made Leanheat's solution easily approachable by simplifying communication and designing new materials which were iterated throughout the process and taken into use in sales. Main change was that the value proposition for housing companies transformed from energy savings to offering stable indoor conditions.</p>

          <div class="col-md-8 mb60">
            <p>I got confidence in conducting user research and learnt a lot about energy industry as well as limited liability housing company operations. I learned to apply service design methods in different situations. I gained experience in business design and saw how difficult it might be to facilitate customer centricity. I also became really interested in science behind decision making.</p>

            <p>We followed the process of Lean Service Creation. The project started by understanding the customer's business objectives. Then we interviewed district heating companies and board members of limited liability housing companies to understand their painpoints and needs.</p>
            <p>We did a short version of Google Sprint and ideated few concepts based on insights we had gained. The final concept was validated with real users using fake-ads and interviews. For example we distributed brochures for the residents of housing company.</p>
            <p>My role in the project was to conduct user research and to design fake ads and validate our assumptions. In addition, I was presenting the final presentation together with another team member.</p>

            <p>Our final concept was to provide Leanheat's solution as a part of the district heating.

With this solution it would be possible to bypass the decision making about a new investment.</p>

            <p>We followed the d.school design thinking methodology that consists of iterative process of defining the problem, needfinding and benchmarking, brainstorming, prototyping and testing. We did user research with project managers, workers and mobile operators to understand their work and needs to deliver projects.</p>
            <p>In addition we benchmarked a lot of project management tools to find out their best parts and what is still missing. We explored trends that are coming in the next 10-15 years to design a solution that would fit the needs of future workers and take advantage of the evolving technology.</p>
            <p>We did a lot of prototypes to test our assumptions and to generate insights. These prototypes included for example testing experiences, making wireframes, creating clickable prototypes with Figma and arranging test where a child would lead a project.</p>
            <p>My role in the project was to do user research with the operators and designing the prototypes as well as testing those with real users. In addition, I created clickable prototypes with Figma to gain insights about what the workers want to see in their profiles and on their front page.</p>

            <p>In addition we included the client's view to the final prototype, since we find out that it is important for customers to recieve real-time information about the projects and usually receiving that kind of information might take a long time and it should be always available. <a href="http://me310nokia.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">The prototype of the final design concept can be found here</a>.</p>

            <p>During the 6 months I learned a lot about how to plan prototypes and think about what is important to do and why. In addition I learned how important is to communicate with team members especially when other half of the team is abroad. Since the design challenge was so broad it was first hard to define the real problem but in the end we gained a lot of positive feedback that we focues on the people side and designed a solution which concentrates on people compared to the project management tools which are available nowadays.</p>

            <p class="title">Different layouts for news</p>
            <p>These feature news are different from the normal news article and the main focus is in storytelling and the visuals. My responsibility was to prototype different kinds of storytelling forms and then to plan and execute the layouts done by graphic designers. I also had a role in proof reading and commenting the article itself. Example projects: <a href="https://yle.fi/uutiset/3-9573556" target="_blank">Unohdettujen kyl√§</a>, <a href="http://yle.fi/uutiset/3-9182375" target="_blank">Kiire syntyy p√§√§n sis√§ll√§</a>, <a href="http://yle.fi/uutiset/3-8171116" target="_blank">Ylen suuri olutopas</a>, <a href="http://yle.fi/uutiset/3-9408566" target="_blank">Vallan huipulla</a></p>
            <p class="title">Tests where the user gets feedback based on answers</p>
            <p>Tests are somewhat popular forms to give the users different kind of interaction to learn something new or to give the user ability to compare themself with the rest of population. Examples tests: <a href="http://yle.fi/uutiset/3-9082142" target="_blank">Lapsen kasvatusta vai v√§kivaltaa? Testaa tiet√§myksesi voimank√§yt√∂n rajoista</a>, <a href="https://yle.fi/uutiset/3-8066783" target="_blank">Seksi: Kuinka hyv√§√§, montako kumppania? Vertaa itse√§si muuhun Suomeen</a></p>
            <p class="title">Services which are based on data</p>
            <p>Data visualization and interactive way to explore data is a chanche to give the user to ability to learn and explore the data how they want it. In these projects I requested and worked with the data and coded the end result. Example project: <a href="http://yle.fi/uutiset/3-8944178" target="_blank">Mik√§ on Suomen yleisin nimip√§iv√§? Se selvi√§√§ Ylen nimip√§iv√§koneesta</a></p>
