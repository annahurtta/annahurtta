            <h3>How to sell services for limited liability housing companies in a customer centric way?</h3>
            <p class="bold">Case Master's Thesis - Lenheat- Design Science Research project</p>
            <!-- <p><span class="bold">Design challenge:</span> How to sell services for limited liability housing companies in a customer centric way.</p>-->
            <p><span class="bold">Design process:</span> The research followed the design science research methodology and it was conducted as a service design project with the help of LSC. I interviewed board members of limited liability housing companies in order to understand what affects the buying decision making. Based on the interviews I did experiments where the knowledge from the interviews were taken into practice to find out how the current sales process could be improved. Since, based on the interviews and observstions, the biggest bottle necks in the current sales process were in awarness, enganement and purchase phase, I focused the research in those steps. To find out for example which pricing model was thought "easiest to buy" among the limited liability housing company board members I created three different fake-ads which had three different pricing models. Then those ads were shown for people who were in a limited liability housing company fair and asked for feedback. Based on the testing, the case company decided to move from investment based model to a service fee model.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Result:</span> The results of the study indicate, that the limited liability housing company’s buying decision making is affected by the motivation of the board, the deputy landlord’s role and board culture. I identifed three different board culture and suggested to target the most active ones since they have experienced people in the board and a desire to make the limited liability housing company better compared to the board type where the mission is to keep the situation as it is currently. Moreover, the limited liability housing companies should not be considered as business customers. The results also indicated, that the sales process should be more customer-centric and designed in a way that it provides consulting and support for the members of the board in a limited liability housing company. In addition the communication towards limited liability housing companies changed from energy saving towards offering stable indoor conditions, because the interviews showed that the most important responsibility of a board is to provide good and stable indoor conditions to all residents.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Aftermath:</span> I got confidence in conducting user research and learnt a lot about energy industry as well as limited liability housing company operations. In addition I learned about customer journey mapping and how that can be used in improving the sales process. I gained experience in business design and saw how difficult it might be to facilitate customer centricity. I also became really interested in science behind decision making.</p>

            <!--<p><span class="bold">Design challenge:</span> Design a concept that attracts limited liability housing companies to get Leanheat's solution in use.</p>-->
            <p><span class="bold">Design process:</span> We followed the process of Lean service creation that includes customer insights and interviewing, business objectives, value propositions, experimenting and MVP design. We did interviews with private housing companies, district heating companies and other stakeholders to gain insights from energy efficiency business field as well as customers painpoints and needs. Based on these learnings we created our concept and validated it with real users using fake-ads and interviews. My role in the project was to conduct user research and to design fake ads and validate our assumptions. In addition, I was presenting the final presentation together with another team member.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Result:</span> Our final concept was to provide Leanheat's solution as a part of the district heating contracts that the private housing companies already have. With this solution we could also bypass the decision making about a new investment.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Aftermath:</span> My build-measure-learn mindset became stronger and I gained a lot of domain information from a complex business scenario. Leanheat was super impressed  with our validation and they gained important insights from private housing companies. The solution was described as simple yet effective.</p>

            <h3>What is the next generation of project management in a large global company?</h3>
            <p class="bold">Case Nokia - Aalto University - ME310 Stanford Design Innovation project</p>
            <!--<p><span class="bold">Design challenge:</span> Design the next generation of project management in a large global company.</p>-->
            <p><span class="bold">Design process:</span> We followed the d.school design thinking methodology that consists of iterative process of defining the problem, needfinding and benchmarking, brainstorming, prototyping and testing. We did user research with project managers, workers and mobile operators to understand their work and needs to deliver projects. In addition we benchmarked a lot of project management tools to find out their best parts and what is still missing. We explored trends that are coming in the next 10-15 years to design a solution that would fit the needs of future workers and take advantage of the evolving technology. We did a lot of prototypes to test our assumptions and to generate insights. These prototypes included for example testing experiences, making wireframes, creating clickable prototypes with Figma and arranging test where a child would lead a project. My role in the project was to do user research with the operators and designing the prototypes as well as testing those with real users. In addition, I created clickable prototypes with Figma to gain insights about what the workers want to see in their profiles and on their front page.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Result:</span> We designed a digital home for future workers who value self-development, connection with other co-workers and transparency between all stakeholders. The final design connects people with projects according to workers profile and goals. In addition we included the client's view to the final prototype, since we find out that it is important for customers to recieve real-time information about the projects and usually receiving that kind of information might take a long time and it should be always available. The prototype of the final design concept can be found <a href="http://me310nokia.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Aftermath:</span> During the 6 months I learned a lot about how to plan prototypes and think about what is important to do and why. In addition I learned how important is to communicate with team members especially when other half of the team is abroad. Since the design challenge was so broad it was first hard to define the real problem but in the end we gained a lot of positive feedback that we focues on the people side and designed a solution which concentrates on people compared to the project management tools which are available nowadays.</p>

            <p><span class="bold">Different layouts for news:</span> These feature news are different from the normal news article and the main focus is in storytelling and the visuals. My responsibility was to prototype different kinds of storytelling forms and then to plan and execute the layouts done by graphic designers. I also had a role in proof reading and commenting the article itself. Example projects: <a href="https://yle.fi/uutiset/3-9573556" target="_blank">Unohdettujen kylä</a>, <a href="http://yle.fi/uutiset/3-9182375" target="_blank">Kiire syntyy pään sisällä</a>, <a href="http://yle.fi/uutiset/3-8171116" target="_blank">Ylen suuri olutopas</a>, <a href="http://yle.fi/uutiset/3-9408566" target="_blank">Vallan huipulla</a></p>
            <p><span class="bold">Tests where the user gets feedback based on answers:</span> Tests are somewhat popular forms to give the users different kind of interaction to learn something new or to give the user ability to compare themself with the rest of population. Examples tests: <a href="http://yle.fi/uutiset/3-9082142" target="_blank">Lapsen kasvatusta vai väkivaltaa? Testaa tietämyksesi voimankäytön rajoista</a>, <a href="http://yle.fi/uutiset/3-9082142" target="_blank">Seksi: Kuinka hyvää, montako kumppania? Vertaa itseäsi muuhun Suomeen</a></p>
            <p><span class="bold">Services which are based on data:</span> Data visualization and interactive way to explore data is a chanche to give the user to ability to learn and explore the data how they want it. In these projects I requested and worked with the data and coded the end result. Example project: <a href="http://yle.fi/uutiset/3-8944178" target="_blank">Mikä on Suomen yleisin nimipäivä?
