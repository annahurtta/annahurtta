          </div>
          <div class="col-md-8 mb60">
            <p>Leanheat provides a software solution that enables the space heating optimization of centrally heated multifamily residential buildings. This is done by installing wireless sensors to track temperature and humidity, and a connection to the central heating controller is established. The system collects data from apartments, heating system and weather in order to automatically create a thermodynamic model for the building. Then the space heating is optimized based on the parameters resulting a minimized simultaneous usage of heat and thus lowering the peak loads caused by it.</p>

          <div class="col-md-4">
            <p class="title">Business Objective</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-md-8 mb60">
            <p>In Finland, from the big apartment buildings around one third is owned by the professional property owners and in that specific market the case company is already the market lead. The rest of the buildings are housing companies which means that reaching them as clients is strategically important in order to grow bigger in the market. Leanheat and district heating companies are forming partnerships because the system provides a way for the district heating companies to optimize their energy production. Moreover, consumer customers are becoming active in acquiring services which means that the energy companies should be more active in providing service business in order to engage better with their customers.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-md-4">
            <p class="title">Goal</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-md-8 mb60">
            <p>Selling services for housing companies requires resources and knowledge about how they operate and the reasons for their actions. On top of that, district heating companies are valuable since currently they have their existing customer relationships with housing companies because they provide them heat.</p>
            <p>The goal of the study was to create new and better understanding about the purchase decision making process inside housing companies by exploring the background motivation for people to be in the board and what affects the decision making. Additionally, the goal was to design and develop a sales process guidance and guidelines on how to reach the potential market of the housing companies</p>
            <p>The main research questions were</p>
              <ul class="responsibilities">
                <li>What affects the purchase decision making process in a limited liability housing companies?</li>
                <li>How to improve current sales process with the knowledge of limited liability housing company’s decision making process?</li>
              </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="col-md-4">
            <p class="title">Design process</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-md-8 mb60">
            <p>The research followed the design science research methodology and it was conducted as a service design project with the help of Lean Service Creation. I started the project by forming an understanding of the current state of the business. I took part in different meetings and conducted interviews with the board members of housing companies. Additionally, I designed support material for sales and iterated those based on feedback and interviews.</p>

            <p class="caption mb40">The research process and the conducted activities.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">User research & data gathering:</span> To answer the first research question I interviewed board members of housing companies. I wanted to find out why they were part of the board, what things influence their decision making and how they make investment decisions. I decided to do semi-structured interviews in order to discover the real feelings and operations inside the board. In addition, I wanted to understand the current sales process by mapping customer journey together with energy company. Based on the insights I decided to focus my research on awareness, engagement and purchase phases because those were the biggest bottlenecks.</p>

            <p class="caption mb20">Example insights from interviews.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Prototyping:</span> I designed new material to support the sales for consumer customers. I also took part in an open day event where I was able to test personal selling and provide support for the decision making. Lastly, I designed fake ads to test and find out which pricing model is thought as “easiest to buy” among housing companies. The test was conducted in a housing company fair where the ads were shown for board members and asked their feedback.</p>

            <p class="title">Result</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-md-8 mb60">
            <p>Main insights gained from the interviews were that the purchase decision making is mainly affected by the motivation of the board, the deputy landlord’s role and board culture.</p>
            <p>I identifed three different board cultures based on their goals and board members. Additionally, I also suggested improvments for the awarness, engagement and purchase phase. For example, the pricing model moved from investment based to service fee based model.</p>

            <p class="caption mb20">Identified board cultures.</p>
            <p>I made Leanheat's solution easily approachable by simplifying communication and designing new materials which were iterated throughout the process and taken into use in sales. Main change was that the value proposition for housing companies transformed from energy savings to offering stable indoor conditions.</p>
            <p>Lastly I designed a flyer where I wrote the main insights learned from the research. The flyer can be shared for example to district heating companies.</p>

            <p class="title">Aftermath</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-md-8 mb60">
            <p>I got confidence in conducting user research and learnt a lot about energy industry as well as limited liability housing company operations. I learned to apply service design methods in different situations. I gained experience in business design and saw how difficult it might be to facilitate customer centricity. I also became really interested in science behind decision making.</p>
